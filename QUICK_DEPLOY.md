## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Map view** will show a placeholder on web (this is fine for verification)
- **Some native features** (camera, push notifications) won't work on web
- **PayFast just needs to see**: Your app exists, has wallet functionality, and payment integration
- **The web version shows**: Login, Wallet, Payments, Business listings

## 🎯 What PayFast Will See

✅ Functional app with navigation
✅ Authentication/login screen  
✅ Wallet screen with balance
✅ Payment/top-up functionality
✅ Business listings
✅ Map view (placeholder is acceptable)

npm run build:web
```

The new build will be in the `dist` folder.
